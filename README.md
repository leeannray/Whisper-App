# Whisper-App
Whisper-ma-phone: a react and redux social app (for us seuss fans)â€¦

Congratulations. Today is your day. 

Welcome to whisper-ma-phone: an app to take you places...oh the places you'll go. Here's what I had in mind:

AS A developer I want to create an app to connect millenials with one another through posts that share personal photos, comments, and private messages or chat rooms
SO THAT they can receive a positive and encouraging message during this unique time in our history and feel less distanced from one another through a more positive platform
IN ORDER TO walk through how to develop a React app (for developers) while also instilling a more positive social media message for our generation and others (including those who will, in the future, develop similar apps)
SO THAT all of us 90's kids can be more connected, empowered, and motivated

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# This app was created using React by the amazing people at Facebook
