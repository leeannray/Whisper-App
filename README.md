# Whisper-App

Whisper-ma-phone: a react and redux social app (for us seuss fans)…you're the guide. Don't go down some not-so-smart street. Oh, the heights we'll reach: whisper-ma-phone (a very legitimate quote by doctor seuss himself.) 

Do you dare to go in?

Congratulations. Today is your day. 

Welcome to whisper-ma-phone: an app to take you places...oh the places you'll go. Here's what I had in mind:

AS A developer I want to create an app to connect millenials with one another through posts that share personal photos, comments, and private messages or chat rooms
SO THAT they can receive a positive and encouraging message during this unique time in our history and feel less distanced from one another through a more positive platform
IN ORDER TO walk through how to develop a React app (for developers) while also instilling a more positive social media message for our generation and others (including those who will, in the future, develop similar apps)
SO THAT all of us 90's kids can be more connected, empowered, and motivated

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# This app was created using React by the amazing people at Facebook

The waiting place…Everyone is just waiting. NO that's not for…us? Oh the places we'll go! 

Ready for anything under the sky: hope the Seuss family doesn't sue but hope you all enjoy a stroll down a nostalgic lane.

Be sure when you step...and just never forget to be dextrous..and NEVER mix up your left right foot for your left. 

The places we can go. Welcome to the waiting room. 

*excuse me, what time is it? my swatch says 1994. do you know when the bus comes?*
