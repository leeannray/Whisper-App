# USER STORY
## Whisper: a Social Media Platform for Kids
### The Waiting Place

AS A developer

I WANT TO create a safe environment for kids to connect with one another in the forms of sharing photos, comments, and private messages or by creating chatrooms for them to connect with eachother

SO THAT kids can feel safe, with eventual parental monitoring of such an app, by logging in with a secure username of their choosing and share their experiences with classmates in real-time

IN ORDER TO for kids to see the opportunities the internet holds, as well as the excitement of the internet and what it takes to develop such apps (tutorials included as a long-term ICEBOX idea) while also allowing them to connect with eachother through chatrooms/messages, photos, and posts
