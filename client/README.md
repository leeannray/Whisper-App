# Whisper-App

Whisper-ma-phone: a react and redux social app (for us seuss fans)…you're the guide. Don't go down some not-so-smart street. Oh, the heights we'll reach: whisper-ma-phone (a very legitimate quote by doctor seuss himself.) 

Do you dare to go in?

Congratulations. Today is your day. 

Welcome to whisper-ma-phone: an app to take you places...oh the places you'll go. Here's what I had in mind:

AS A developer I want to create an app to connect millenials with one another through posts that are secure/private (via validation and authentication methods) to share personal photos, comments, and private messages or chat rooms
SO THAT they can share positive messages during this unique time in our history through unique usernames, personal photos, posts, and ability to know what friends and potential new friends are up to in real-time
IN ORDER TO walk through how to develop a React app (for developers) while also instilling a more positive social media message for our generation and others (including those who will, in the future, develop similar apps) via React
SO THAT all of us 90's kids can be more connected, empowered, and motivated through an MERN app

# This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

AND:

# This app was created using React by the amazing people at Facebook: many thanks

The waiting place…

Everyone is just waiting. NO that's not for…us? We've got places to go. 

# Credit

Thank you Seuss family. Developers: hope this helps--oh the places we can go. Users: all alone--we are quite a lot. Scary [explitive] BUT--,sure--sometimes we go on and on … like this README? So, why are you still reading. Get on your way.

# Still reading?

Be sure when you step...and just never forget to be dextrous..and NEVER mix up your left right foot for your left. 

The places we can go. Welcome to the waiting room.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
